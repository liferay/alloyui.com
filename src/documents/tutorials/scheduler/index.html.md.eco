#### Getting Started

First load the seed file if you haven't yet.

``` html
<script src="<%= @getCdnSeed() %>"></script>
```

Then initialize AlloyUI and load the Scheduler module.

``` javascript
AUI().use(
  'aui-scheduler',
  function(A) {
    // code goes here
  }
);
```
---

#### Using Scheduler

Create an HTML element with a wrapper div:

``` html
<div id="wrapper">
  <div id="myScheduler"></div>
</div>
```
<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note:</strong> using Scheduler without a "wrapper" `div` may produce undesirable results due to its styling within AlloyUI.  Try it with or without a wrapper to see how Scheduler works with surrounding elements.
</div>

Now create a new instance of Scheduler component.

First, let's create an `events` variable where we stored our first calendar event, setting its name via `content` and a start and end date. Then we'll initialize the calendar view we're going to use, `weekView`.

Finally, we'll create a new Scheduler with its `boundingBox` set to our HTML element, its `date` set to when we scheduled our first event, and pass in `events` for `items` and `weekView` for `views`, setting `render` to `true` so that it renders on load.

``` javascript
AUI().use(
  'aui-scheduler',
  function(A) {
    var events = [
      {
        content: 'Partial Lunar Eclipse',
        endDate: new Date(2013, 4, 25, 5),
        startDate: new Date(2012, 4, 25, 1)
      }
    ];

    var weekView = new A.SchedulerWeekView();

    new A.Scheduler(
      {
        boundingBox: '#myScheduler',
        date: new Date(2013, 4, 25),
        items: events,
        render: true,
        views: [weekView]
      }
    );
  }
);
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note:</strong> you don't have to set `date` inside your new Scheduler instance, but be forewarned, if you don't supply a date, Scheduler will use the current date as its starting date, sometimes making it hard to find your events!
</div>

#### Configuring Scheduler

There are some other optional parameters that you can pass to your Scheduler instance.

For example, you can add other views to your `views` option with the Scheduler View constructors.  This will allow you to view your events in different formats.  You can also set `activeView` to the view you want Scheduler to start on.

``` javascript
AUI().use(
  'aui-scheduler',
  function(A) {
    var events = [
      {
        content: 'Partial Lunar Eclipse',
        endDate: new Date(2013, 4, 25, 5),
        startDate: new Date(2013, 4, 25, 1)
      }
    ];

    var agendaView = new A.SchedulerAgendaView();
    var dayView = new A.SchedulerDayView();
    var weekView = new A.SchedulerWeekView();
    var monthView = new A.SchedulerMonthView();

    new A.Scheduler(
      {
        activeView: weekView,
        boundingBox: '#myScheduler',
        date: new Date(2013, 4, 25),
        items: events,
        render: true,
        views: [dayView, weekView, monthView, agendaView]
      }
    );
  }
);
```

Adding `eventRecorder` to your options via the `NewEventRecorder` constructor allows you change the duration of existing events and create new events directly inside Scheduler, all of which are recorded and saved in Scheduler.

``` javascript
AUI().use(
  'aui-scheduler',
  function(A) {
    var events = [
      {
        content: 'Partial Lunar Eclipse',
        endDate: new Date(2013, 4, 25, 5),
        startDate: new Date(2013, 4, 25, 1)
      }
    ];

    var agendaView = new A.SchedulerAgendaView();
    var dayView = new A.SchedulerDayView();
    var weekView = new A.SchedulerWeekView();
    var monthView = new A.SchedulerMonthView();

    var eventRecorder = new A.SchedulerEventRecorder();

    new A.Scheduler(
      {
        boundingBox: '#myScheduler',
        date: new Date(2013, 4, 25),
        eventRecorder: eventRecorder,
        items: events,
        render: true,
        activeView: weekView,
        views: [dayView, weekView, monthView, agendaView]
      }
    );
  }
);
```

You can even customize your individual events with a number of options, including `color`, `meeting`, `reminder`, and `disabled`.  Events can also span multiple days and overlap each other.


``` javascript
AUI().use(
  'aui-scheduler',
  function(A) {
    var events = [
      {
        content: 'Partial Lunar Eclipse',
        endDate: new Date(2012, 4, 25, 5),
        startDate: new Date(2013, 4, 25, 1)
      },
      {
        color: "#8d8",
        content: 'Earth Day Lunch',
        disabled: true,
        endDate: new Date(2013, 4, 22, 13),
        meeting: true,
        reminder: true,
        startDate: new Date(2013, 22, 12, 12)
      },
      {
        content: "Weeklong",
        endDate: new Date(2013, 4, 21),
        startDate: new Date(2013, 4, 27)
      },
    ];

    var agendaView = new A.SchedulerAgendaView();
    var dayView = new A.SchedulerDayView();
    var weekView = new A.SchedulerWeekView();
    var monthView = new A.SchedulerMonthView();

    var eventRecorder = new A.SchedulerEventRecorder();

    new A.Scheduler(
      {
        activeView: weekView,
        boundingBox: '#myScheduler',
        date: new Date(2012, 4, 25),
        eventRecorder: eventRecorder,
        items: events,
        render: true,
        views: [dayView, weekView, monthView, agendaView]
      }
    );
  }
);
```
